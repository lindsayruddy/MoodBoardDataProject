# MoodBoardDataProject
Mood boards created based on tags such as color, material, nature, furniture..

Data Side —> On the data side we will need to find images, throw them into a directory and add tags to each.
## Create the repository
## Create the database
## How do we want to add these tags to the image
#### Have a file with dictionaries/database that have the image name and the tags
#### That way when we begin searching through these we can take index 1 and use it to get the image at the end and the rest to take the tags
## Getter Function
## After we add tags to the images and put all of that into a database, we want to make sorting fundtions that will take in a certain tag (whether we are sorting on mood, or color, ….) and returns us the top 3 images
## Create functions that takes in multuple moods or tags, calls the sort function on them and then returns a list of X (number we decide is best for the board) image names and returns it
## We want to take the returned list above, and add these images nicely onto a document
